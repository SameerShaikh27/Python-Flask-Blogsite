        <p>Let's start with Hii, to all my 'BE LIMITLESS' Blog friends. My name is Stefan Salvatore as you all know.
        I started this blog in the year 2019 of January. Right after Christmas Holidays. The thing that motivated me to create this blog is a place called MUNNAR which is situated in KERELA. That place is full of greenery, fresh air, mountains, waterfall, and beautiful lakes. I have never seen such place before in my 20 years of life. Thanks, to my friends because they insisted me for the trip. Before that trip I always use to think that travelling is headache, tiring, and exhausting. But that trip change my whole perception towards travelling and exploring the places. Trekking makes you achieve a peace of mind. It makes you to meet different people and get to know about different cultures. It broaden your horizon. It makes you feel happy, satisfied, and confident for the next obstacles in your life. Final words are, Always explore the new places and nature because you never know when your life would come to an end while you are busy in this never stopping daily loop of your life. BE HAPPY and BE LIMITLESS.</p>
